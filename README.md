Welcome to the Boss Machine API! This API serves as the backend for the Boss Machine application, a management tool designed for accomplished (evil) entrepreneurs. With this API, you can manage your minions, track your brilliant million-dollar ideas, and handle all those annoying meetings that keep getting added to your busy schedule. This is a project for Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineer Career Path.
